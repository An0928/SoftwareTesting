> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- 
     From this software testing assignment, I learned a lot. Before working on this assignment, I only learned basic definitions and various testing terminologies, as well as some operations in software testing, from videos. However, this testing experience taught me what steps to take when conducting tests. It provided me with a practical understanding of the testing process, including test planning, execution, and result analysis. This hands-on experience significantly enhanced my knowledge and skills in software testing.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- 
    To effectively manage test scenarios and cases, I immersed myself in the project requirements, envisioning the user's journey within the application. By simulating user interactions and exploring every aspect of the application, I identified key test scenarios. For instance, when examining the sign-up feature, I imagined the process from a new user's perspective, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the application's functionality. With the test scenarios identified, I proceeded to craft test cases for each one, meticulously detailing the steps, expected outcomes, and any relevant preconditions or postconditions. Embracing a comprehensive approach, I incorporated negative test scenarios to uncover potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities. This systematic methodology ensured thorough test coverage and a more robust testing process. Furthermore, I organized the test cases into distinct categories aligned with the application's features, such as the login, register, and issue pages. Each category received a unique identifier for clarity and organization, facilitating efficient tracking of testing progress and ensuring comprehensive coverage across the application. This structured approach enhanced clarity and efficiency in managing the test cases, ultimately contributing to a more effective testing process overall.

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 -     
    Microsoft Excel serves as an excellent tool for test case management due to its simplicity, accessibility, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. Its user-friendly interface and familiar spreadsheet format make it easy for testers, even those without prior experience with specialized test management tools, to create and organize test cases efficiently. Excel allows testers to customize the layout and structure of their test cases according to project requirements, providing the flexibility to adapt to evolving testing needs. Additionally, Excel spreadsheets can be easily shared and collaborated on by multiple team members simultaneously, promoting teamwork and collaboration. Furthermore, Excel is a cost-effective option, as it is often included in standard office software suites or available at a low cost. While Excel may lack some of the advanced features found in dedicated test management tools, it remains a practical choice for small teams or individual testers looking for a straightforward and budget-friendly solution for managing their test cases.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- 
    I mainly use Visual Studio Code to edit files. It's a tool that helps me write and organize my code more easily. VS Code has a lot of helpful features that make coding simpler, like highlighting important parts of the code, suggesting what to write next, and helping me find and fix mistakes. It's also really good for working with other people on the same project, as we can all see and edit the code together. 

## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
-
    During the testing process, I didn't encounter any significant challenges or obstacles, largely due to the detailed guidance from Canvas. The comprehensive instructions and clear expectations outlined in the assignment facilitated a smooth and efficient testing experience. With a clear understanding of the requirements and expectations, I was able to navigate through the testing tasks seamlessly, executing test cases and documenting results with ease. 

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
-
    
    While I haven't personally used GitHub before, I'm familiar with its purpose and functionality. I've heard about GitHub through various sources, such as online tutorials and videos, where it's often mentioned as a platform for hosting and sharing projects. For instance, I've come across YouTube tutorials that demonstrate how to leverage GitHub to collaborate on coding projects or contribute to open-source initiatives. Although I haven't had hands-on experience with GitHub yet, I recognize its significance in the software development community and its role as a central hub for version control, collaboration, and project management.
      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- 
    If tasked with automating these test cases in the future, I'd choose Selenium WebDriver with Java as my tool. Selenium WebDriver is widely used and has strong features for automating tasks on websites. Java is a good programming language that's flexible and helps write code that's easy to maintain. Together, they make a powerful combination for automating tests effectively. With Selenium WebDriver, I can automate different things users do on a website, check if everything works correctly, and test on different web browsers. Java's ability to organize code well and handle big projects means the automation can grow and adapt as needed. 


## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- 
    1. Proactive and detail-oriented approach to testing
    2. Ability to collaborate with business partners and software developers
    3. Development of detailed test plans and assessment of risks
    4. Troubleshooting and providing detailed debug information
    5. Strong communication and cross-functional collaboration skills
    6. Experience in manual testing and quality assurance
    7. Proficiency with test management tools such as HP ALM, Jira, or TestRail
    8. Analytical skills and problem-solving abilities
    9. Strong understanding of software testing concepts and methodologies
    10. Experience with automated testing frameworks like Selenium and HP UFT



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- 
    On the technical side, I will aim to demonstrate proficiency in writing comprehensive test plans and test cases tailored to specific project requirements. I will have to learn executing manual test cases and documenting results accurately, alongside familiarity with test management tools like HP ALM, Jira, or TestRail.  What more, I am acquiring knowledge of automated testing frameworks such as Selenium and basic programming languages like Java or Python to enhance my testing capabilities. On the soft skills front, I prioritize attention to detail, problem-solving abilities, and effective communication skills. I think i need to have the showcasing adaptability, time management, critical thinking, and a continuous learning mindset to thrive in dynamic testing environments.



## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
-
    This project provided me with a valuable opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge of software testing in a practical context. Through tasks such as writing test cases, identifying test scenarios, and managing defects, I gained hands-on experience that reinforced concepts learned through ISTQB videos and coursework. This practical application helped solidify my understanding of testing methodologies, test planning, and test execution processes. Additionally, it highlighted the importance of attention to detail, thoroughness in testing, and effective communication in documenting and reporting issues.
