
## Summary (Summarize the bug encountered concisely)
    
    While creating a new project in GitLab, the option to create a blank project was mistakenly labeled as "black project" instead of "blank project."


## Steps to reproduce     

    Open a web browser and navigate to the GitLab login page
    Enter the username and password of the GitLab account associated with the creator role.
    Click on the "Sign In" button to log in to GitLab.
    Navigate to the project creation page.
    Navigate to the dashboard or homepage of the GitLab instance.
    Look for the option to create a new project. 
    Click on the option to create a new project to proceed to the project creation page.
    Observe the option for creating a blank project.
    On the project creation page the option being labeled as "black project" instead of "blank project."

## What is the current bug behavior?
    When users try to make a new project in GitLab, they see a mistake. Instead of showing "blank project" like it should, it shows "black project." This mix-up might confuse users because they expect to see "blank project" when they want to start a new project without anything in it. This might make users unsure about which option to choose, and it could make it harder for them to start their projects the way they want.
     

## What is the expected correct behavior?

    When users want to start a new project without anything in it, they should see a button or label that says "blank project." This makes it clear to them that if they choose this option, they'll get a new project with nothing in it, like a fresh canvas. It's important that the words match what the button actually does, so users know what to expect when they click on it.
     
## Relevant logs and/or screenshots

    Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks ( ``` ) to format console output, logs, and code, as it's very hard to read otherwise.

## Possible fixes
    The problem is probably because of a small mistake in the code that controls how the project creation options are labeled on the website. To fix it, the developers just need to find where the mistake is and change the label so it says "blank project" instead of "black project." Once they make this change, the label will match what the button actually does, and users won't get confused anymore.

## Priority
